                    This repository is more of a hackjob, in that I have learned the bare minimum of ASP.NET and React from scratch to be able to make basic changes to the site.<br/>
                    Themed some stuff, implemented an authentication system and a storage reporting feature. Aside from that, this is pretty much a pre-baked solution.<br/><br/>
